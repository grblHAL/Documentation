# grblHAL documentation

[Doxygen](https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen) has been chosen to generate documentation from the sources as this provides a skeleton version out-of-the box which can then be expanded upon.

*** Work in progress ***

### grblHAL core

A temporary home for the main part is found [here](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/).

For convenience, [here is direct link to the HAL structure](http://svn.io-engineering.com/grblHAL/html/structgrbl__hal__t.html) which has the most important information for driver developers.
